## Coding for Reproducible Research

This training programme provides a series workshops to support researchers at the University of Exeter to expand their skillsets and position them to confidently perform the informatics research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. The programme covers not only training on specific languages, such as Python, R, and Unix/Linux,  but additionally incorporates training relating to good practise and reproducible working methods that is designed to be agnostic of programming language. In this way we offer a holistic perspective as to how programming tasks should be approached, ultimately providing researchers with the tools and knowledge to feel confident in what they are doing. Delivery will start from Oct 2022 with an emphaisis on beginners workshops in the first year. From Oct 2023 we will expand into intermediate and advanced topics, providing opportunities for novices through to more experienced users. All workshops are open to any staff or student, from any college or department and accessible from any campus. 

These workshops are brought to you by the University of Exeter Research Software Engineering Group, [University of Exeter Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/idsai/), [University of Exeter Researcher Development](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/doctoralcollege/early-career-researchers/traininganddevelopment/rdprogramme/) and the [University of Exeter Doctoral College](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/doctoralcollege/).

## Acknowledgements

These courses have been developed by the University of Exeter Research Software Engineering Group along with other researchers at the univeristy who are enthuastic about sharing their skills with the wider research community. Many of them are adaptations of existing open source courses, for which we are greatful. If you have benefited in any way from these courses and want to support the intiatives long term sustainablity then please take the time to complete our feedback survey, recommend it to your collegues, and enthuse about it to your senior leadership team.
