		Guidance for registering for workshops

		<p class="box-msg"> All workshops have the option to attend in person or remotely. Please note that you will need to opt for a method of delivery at the point of registation.  </p>
		<p class="box-subtitle"> Registration </p>
		<p class="box-msg"> Please <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/r9xTtwmXHR" class="box-link">register your interest in a particular course</a> by completing this form. This does not guarantee you a place on your chosen course. Places will be allocated on a first come first served basis once registration closes and you will be asked to re-confirm your availability to attend. </p>
		<p class="box-msg"> All courses are currently scheduled to be held on Streatham Campus. We have some availability for online places for those unable to attend in person, but these are prioritised for those based outside of Exeter, or who have other reasons for to being able to attend in person. We know that some of you prefer to have the option to attend virtually, even if you are in Exeter, but our in experience is the learning process is greatly enhanced when you are in the room with the instructors, helpers and other participants. We therefore strongly encourage anyone who can attend in person to do so. We would also like to emphasise that you are more likely to get an in person place compared to a virtual place. </p>
		<p class="box-msg"> If the workshop you are interested in is not currently open for registration, please sign up to our <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/NwbXs1qApw" class="box-link">mailing list</a> to get priority notification of when it opens. </p>
